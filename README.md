# Ephox Coding Challenge

## Part A
- [x] Invoke TinyMCE in a simple HTML page

Part A was fairly simple and straight forward. Documentation was easily understood and clear.


## Part B
- [x] Add a custome dialog using TinyMCE's windowManager

Part B was more complex and not as straight forward. I had to do some research of my own using Google to find out all of the capabilities and exactly how to make it work. The Documentation was slightly vague, especially to someone that has never used the platform.
